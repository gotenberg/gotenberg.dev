This guide is not intended to provide a comprehensive tour of Docker and its orchestrators. Rather, it's designed to
be concise enough to assist beginners in getting started while helping power users sidestep potential pitfalls.

:::danger

We do not recommend exposing your instances to the external world. In terms of security, you should consider Gotenberg
as a database.

:::

## Live Demo ðŸ”¥

Before downloading the Docker image, you might want to experiment with Gotenberg. We offer a demo API for this purpose:

* https://demo.gotenberg.dev

As you navigate through the documentation, feel free to open a terminal or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and try
out the routes using the demo URL.

For instance:

```bash
curl \
--request POST https://demo.gotenberg.dev/forms/chromium/convert/url \
--form url=https://sparksuite.github.io/simple-html-invoice-template/ \
-o my.pdf
```

:::info

The demo operates on a [Render](https://render.com) instance with 512MB of RAM and 0.5 CPU.

:::

At present, the restrictions are:

* A maximum of two requests per second per IP.
* A body limit of 5MB.

## Docker

To start a default Docker container of Gotenberg, run:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 gotenberg/gotenberg:8
```

Alternatively, using the historic Docker repository from our sponsor [TheCodingMachine](https://www.thecodingmachine.com):

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 thecodingmachine/gotenberg:8
```

:::info

The API will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

:::

## Docker Compose

Incorporating Gotenberg into your Docker Compose services stack is as straightforward as:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  # Your other services.

  gotenberg:
    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
```

:::info


The API will be accessible at [gotenberg:3000](http://gotenberg:3000) within your Docker Compose network.
This means your other services can interact with Gotenberg using [gotenberg:3000](http://gotenberg:3000).

:::

---

If you want to expose the API to your *localhost*, consider adding a `ports` section:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  # Your other services.

  gotenberg:
    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

:::info

The API will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

:::

## Kubernetes

The Docker image employs a specific non-root user, named *gotenberg*, with a User ID (uid) and Group ID (gid) of **1001**.

When detailing the pod's deployment specification, remember to include:

```yaml
securityContext:
  privileged: false
  runAsUser: 1001
```

Other than that, ensure to allocate sufficient memory and CPU resources (at least 512Mi for memory and 0.2 for CPU).

A community Helm chart is also available at [MaikuMori/helm-charts](https://github.com/MaikuMori/helm-charts) and on
[ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/maikumori/gotenberg).

## Cloud Run

If cost-efficiency is a priority for you, [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) could be an appealing option.

We have a dedicated Docker image tag specifically for this provider:

```
gotenberg/gotenberg:8-cloudrun
```

Alternatively, using the historic Docker repository from our sponsor [TheCodingMachine](https://www.thecodingmachine.com):

```
thecodingmachine/gotenberg:8-cloudrun
```

There are a few limitations to be aware of:

1. Consider using HTTP/2 to bypass the [32MB request size limit](https://cloud.google.com/run/quotas?hl=en).
2. Consider disabling the [webhook feature](/docs/configuration#webhook) as it does not work on Cloud Run.
3. Consider enabling auto-start for [Chromium](/docs/configuration#chromium) and/or [LibreOffice](/docs/configuration#libreoffice).

## Modules Configuration

The Docker image internally employs a binary that offers flags to configure its multiple modules (for more detailed
information, refer to the [configuration guide](/docs/configuration)).

To set one or more flags, it's necessary to override the Docker image's default command.

For example, with the Docker CLI:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 gotenberg/gotenberg:8 gotenberg --my-module-property=foo
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  # Your other services.

  gotenberg:
    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
    command:
      - "gotenberg"
      - "--my-module-property=foo"
```

:::caution

Do not redefine the Gotenberg Docker image default entrypoint, but override the command instead. See this
[issue](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/issues/480#issuecomment-1232064017) for more details.

## What's next?

Now that you have Gotenberg up and running, you can start using it. Install a custom [client](clients) or
read the [routes guide](/docs/routes) to learn more.
