title: What is Gotenberg?
---

[Gotenberg](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg) is a Docker-powered stateless API for PDF files.

## In other words...

* It is a Docker image that incorporates all necessary dependencies, eliminating the need for individual environment
installations.
* It scales and operates seamlessly within a distributed framework.
* It features *multipart/form-data* endpoints for converting numerous document formats into PDF files, among other
capabilities.
* It supports HTTP/2 (classic or H2C).

From a technical perspective, Gotenberg is built on a modular structure that facilitates diverse functionalities.
For example, the Chromium module is specifically designed to convert HTML documents into PDF files.

Every module within Gotenberg is independently configurable, offering the flexibility to tailor the system according to
your specific requirements.

Gotenberg is open-source and free to use.
