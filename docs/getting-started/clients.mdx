Gotenberg routes accept *multipart/form-data* requests, which are natively supported by most programming languages and tools, including cURL.

Due to popular demand, we and the community have developed several clients for easier integration:

- Our *official* PHP client is available in the [gotenberg/gotenberg-php](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg-php) package.
- A range of community clients can be found on the [Awesome list](https://github.com/gotenberg/awesome-gotenberg#clients).

In our upcoming [routes](/docs/routes) guide, you'll learn how to use Gotenberg's endpoints. While we’ll provide basic
cURL examples, remember that there are multiple ways to create *multipart/form-data* requests —
such as using streams or specifying file locations.
