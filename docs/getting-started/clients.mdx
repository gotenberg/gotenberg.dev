Most routes within Gotenberg are designed to accept *multipart/form-data* requests.

**There's no need for a custom client to create these requests, as the majority of programming languages and tools,
including cURL, offer native support.**

However, due to popular demand, both we and our community have developed a range of clients for ease of use:

* Our *official* PHP client for Gotenberg is available in the [gotenberg/gotenberg-php](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg-php) package.
* A collection of community-created clients can be found on the [Awesome list](https://github.com/gotenberg/awesome-gotenberg#clients).

In the upcoming [routes](/docs/routes) guide, we'll explore how to utilize the different routes offered by Gotenberg.

While we will provide basic cURL examples, remember that there are numerous methods to create *multipart/form-data* requests,
such as using streams or specifying file locations directly for form files.
