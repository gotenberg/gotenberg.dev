title: Configuration
---

The Docker image includes a binary with flags to configure its modules. This guide lists all available flags so you can
fine-tune Gotenberg to your needs.

## How To

To set one or more flags, it's necessary to override the Docker image's default command.

For example, with the Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run --rm -p "3000:3000" gotenberg/gotenberg:8 gotenberg --my-module-property=foo
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  # Your other services.

  gotenberg:
    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
    command:
      - "gotenberg"
      - "--my-module-property=foo"
```

:::caution

Do not redefine the Gotenberg Docker image default entrypoint, but override the command instead. See this
[issue](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/issues/480#issuecomment-1232064017) for more details.

:::

---

Alternatively, you can set environment variables that directly correspond to the command-line flags.

For example, with the Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run --rm -p "3000:3000" -e MY_MODULE_PROPERTY=foo gotenberg/gotenberg:8
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  # Your other services.

  gotenberg:
    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8
    environment:
      MY_MODULE_PROPERTY: "foo"
```

## API

The API module is an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 (with H2C support) server.

The following flags allow you to configure the API module:

## Chromium

The Chromium module interacts with the Chromium browser to convert HTML documents to PDF.

A single Chromium browser manages the conversions in a stateful mode, enabling quicker single conversions.
However, due to a lock mechanism, a Chromium browser cannot execute parallel operations.

During periods of heavy load, incoming requests will accumulate in the queue until they are processed, time out, or the
queue reaches its maximum capacity. In the latter case, the request will be terminated prematurely.

To maintain performance under a heavy load, consider increasing the number of Gotenberg instances.

:::caution

The `amd64` Docker image uses Google Chrome stable, while other architectures use Chromium.

## LibreOffice

The LibreOffice module interacts with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to convert numerous documents to PDF,
thanks to [unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv).

A single LibreOffice instance manages the conversions in a stateful mode, enabling quicker single conversions.
However, due to a lock mechanism, a LibreOffice instance cannot execute parallel operations.

During periods of heavy load, incoming requests will accumulate in the queue until they are processed, time out, or the
queue reaches its maximum capacity. In the latter case, the request will be terminated prematurely.

To maintain performance under a heavy load, consider increasing the number of Gotenberg instances.

The following flags allow you to configure the LibreOffice module:

| Flag                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                 | Default |

| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--libreoffice-restart-after</span>  | Number of conversions after which LibreOffice will automatically restart. Set to 0 to disable this feature.                                 | 10      |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--libreoffice-max-queue-size</span> | Maximum request queue size for LibreOffice. Set to 0 to disable this feature.                                                               | 0       |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--libreoffice-auto-start</span>     | Automatically launch LibreOffice upon initialization if set to true; otherwise, LibreOffice will start at the time of the first conversion. | false   |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--libreoffice-start-timeout</span>  | Maximum duration to wait for LibreOffice to start or restart.                                                                               | 20s     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--libreoffice-disable-routes</span> | Disable the routes.                                                                                                                         | false   |

### Switch Language

By default, LibreOffice uses the English language when it converts documents to PDF. You may override this behavior by
building your own Docker image.

For instance, with the German language:

```docker
FROM gotenberg/gotenberg:8

USER root

RUN apt-get update -qq &&\
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -qq --no-install-recommends -t bookworm-backports libreoffice-l10n-de &&\
    sed -i '/de_DE.UTF-8/s/^# //g' /etc/locale.gen &&\
    locale-gen &&\
    # Cleanup.
    # Note: the Debian image does automatically a clean after each install thanks to a hook.
    # Therefore, there is no need for apt-get clean.
    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/24417119/3248473.
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

ENV LANG de_DE.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE de_DE:de
ENV LC_ALL de_DE.UTF-8

USER gotenberg
```

## PDF Engines

The PDF Engines module gathers all engines that can manipulate PDF files. It calls each engine until one successfully
handles a task. A PDF engine is an external tool that Gotenberg leverages to perform a specific task, such as merging
PDF files.

Currently, Gotenberg supports the following PDF engines:

| Engine                                       | Merge | Split | Flatten | Convert into PDF/A & PDF/UA | Read/Write metadata | Name                  |

:::warning

As of Gotenberg *8.13.0*, the flag `--pdfengines-engines` has been deprecated.

:::

## Webhook

The webhook feature enables Gotenberg to upload the output file originating from *multipart/form-data* routes to a
selected destination.

The following flags allow you to configure the Webhook module:

| Flag                                                                   | Description                                                                                  | Default |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-allow-list</span>       | Set the allowed URLs for the webhook feature using a regular expression.                     | All     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-deny-list</span>        | Set the denied URLs for the webhook feature using a regular expression.                      | None    |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-error-allow-list</span> | Set the allowed URLs in case of an error for the webhook feature using a regular expression. | All     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-error-deny-list</span>  | Set the denied URLs in case of an error for the webhook feature using a regular expression.  | None    |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-max-retry</span>        | Set the maximum number of retries for the webhook feature.                                   | 4       |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-retry-min-wait</span>   | Set the minimum duration to wait before trying to call the webhook again.                    | 1s      |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-retry-max-wait</span>   | Set the maximum duration to wait before trying to call the webhook again.                    | 30s     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-client-timeout</span>   | Set the time limit for requests to the webhook.                                              | 30s     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--webhook-disable</span>          | Disable the webhook feature.                                                                 | false   |

## Prometheus

The Prometheus module collects metrics from other modules and exposes an HTTP endpoint that can be scraped by
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

The following flags allow you to configure the Prometheus module:

| Flag                                                                           | Description                                       | Default   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--prometheus-collect-interval</span>      | Set the interval for collecting modules' metrics. | 1s        |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--prometheus-namespace</span>             | Set the namespace of modules' metrics.            | gotenberg |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--prometheus-disable-collect</span>       | Disable the collect of metrics.                   | false     |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--prometheus-disable-route-logging</span> | Disable the route logging.                        | false     |

## Logging

Gotenberg employs a logger that generates structured logs. Structured logs are formatted in a standardized,
machine-readable way, making them extremely beneficial for centralized log management.

The following flags allow you to configure the logger:

| Flag                                                                | Description                                                                      | Default |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--log-format</span>            | Specify the format of logging. Options include auto, json, or text.              | auto    |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--log-level</span>             | Choose the level of logging detail. Options include error, warn, info, or debug. | info    |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--log-fields-prefix</span>     | Prepend a specified prefix to each field in the logs.                            | None    |
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--log-enable-gcp-fields</span> | Enable Google Cloud Platform fields - namely: time, message, severity.           | None    |

:::warning

As of Gotenberg *8.19.0*, the flag `--log-enable-gcp-severity` has been deprecated in favor of `--log-enable-gcp-fields`.

:::

## Graceful Shutdown

To ensure running tasks have enough time to complete, Gotenberg waits for a specific duration before initiating the
shutdown process.

The following flag allows you to configure this duration:

| Flag                                                                               | Description                         | Default |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| <span class="badge badge--secondary">--gotenberg-graceful-shutdown-duration</span> | Set the graceful shutdown duration. | 30s     |

:::info

For Gotenberg versions prior to *8.21.0*, when using the [webhook feature](webhook), make sure this duration is equal to
or longer than the API timeout. This ensures that all asynchronous processes finish before Gotenberg begins its shutdown
sequence.

:::

## Docker Image

### Fonts

The default Docker image is pre-packaged with an extensive assortment of fonts, including Asian ones. If your application
requires additional or specific fonts not included in this collection, you'll need to construct a tailored Docker image
to incorporate those fonts.

**Via .tff files**

```docker
FROM gotenberg/gotenberg:8

USER root

COPY /local/path/to/{font}.ttf /usr/local/share/fonts/{font}.ttf

USER gotenberg
```

Or, if you have many fonts:

```docker
FROM gotenberg/gotenberg:8

USER root

COPY /local/path/to/fonts/* /usr/local/share/fonts/

USER gotenberg
```

---

**Via .deb packages**

```docker
FROM gotenberg/gotenberg:8

USER root

RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -qq --no-install-recommends my-fonts-package

USER gotenberg
```

---

:::info

You could also mount a volume containing your fonts to */usr/local/share/fonts/* as suggested in this
[comment](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/issues/602#issue-1580360200).

:::

### Ownership

The Docker image employs a specific non-root user, named *gotenberg*, with a User ID (uid) and Group ID (gid) of **1001**.
If you want to change these identifiers, you will have to build a custom Docker image:

```docker
FROM gotenberg/gotenberg:8

USER root

RUN usermod -u {uid} -g {gid} gotenberg

USER gotenberg
```
